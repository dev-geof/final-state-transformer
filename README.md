# FINAL STATE TRANSFORMER

[Documentation](https://github.com/dev-geof/final-state-transformer/docs/index.html)

Machine Learning development toolkit, built upon Transformer encoder network architectures and specifically tailored for the realm of high-energy physics and particle event analysis. This toolkit is designed to excel in the tasks of classification and regression on sequences of particle event final state objects. It capitalizes on the inherent ability of these Transformer architectures to capture intricate patterns and dependencies within sequential data. This makes it particularly well-suited for unraveling the complexities present in the final states of particle events, where the subtle interplay of particles usually demands a sophisticated understanding.

The toolkit's adaptability extends beyond its architectural foundation. It incorporates advanced techniques for feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation, ensuring that users can tailor the toolkit to the unique characteristics of their datasets and research objectives.

Designed with a user-friendly interface, the toolkit facilitates seamless integration into research workflows, enabling scientists and researchers to harness the power of state-of-the-art machine learning without compromising on accessibility. Its open architecture encourages collaboration and allows for easy expansion to incorporate future advancements in the field of particle physics.
