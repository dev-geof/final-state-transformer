# FINAL STATE TRANSFORMER

Introducing a machine learning development toolkit built upon Transformer encoder network architectures and specifically crafted for high-energy physics applications. Leveraging the power of the multi-head attention mechanism for capturing long-range dependencies and contextual information in sequences of particle-collision event final-state objects, it allows the design of machine learning models that excel in classification and regression tasks. Featuring a user-friendly interface, this toolkit facilitates integration of Transformer networks into research workflows, enabling scientists and researchers to harness state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.
