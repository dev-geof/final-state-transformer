# FINAL STATE TRANSFORMER

[Documentation]( https://dev-geof.github.io/final-state-transformer/)

Introducing a machine learning development toolkit built apon Transformer encoder network architectures and specifically crafted for high-energy physics applications. Designed to leverage the power of multi-head attention mechanism for capturing long-range dependencies and contextual information in sequences of particle-collision event final-state objects, it allows the design of machine learning models that excel in classification and regression tasks. Featuring a user-friendly interface, this toolkit facilitates seamless integration of Transformer networks into research workflows, enabling scientists and researchers to harness the power of state-of-the-art machine learning without compromising on accessibility.
